This my final programming project for my first quarter at Portland State University.
A command line application that calculates employee's paycheck.
Calculation is based on if the employee is paid salary or hourly, number of normal and overtime hours worked, and if the employee gets any bonuses.
Application includes menus and options for the user to navigate.
Uses input validation and error checking for the data.
